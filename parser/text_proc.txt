 The food is wonderful and it is a lot of fun to be here   
From fourteen states and three foreign countries they come to spend the months from mid-September to June
The concept of good nutrition really began with the garden
The school has always maintained a farm to supply the needs of the school
Throughout the Adirondack region abandoned farm homes and wild orchards bear ghostly testimony that their owners met defeat
 Louis Bromfield's writings excited me as a conservationist 
By 1952 he was convinced he would no longer spray
He locked his equipment in a cabinet where it still remains
After reading  Plowman's Folly  by Edward H. Faulkner  he stopped plowing
Separate pails were kept in the kitchen for coffee grounds and egg shells
It was applied with a compost shredder made from a converted manure spreader
No chemical fertilizers and poisonous insecticides and fungicides are used 
The carrots sometimes don't make it through the winter  
the cabbage and squash keep until March or April
There is never enough corn  peas or strawberries
A new project planned is the use of Bio-Dynamic Starter
New ideas for improving nutrition came with the study of soil treatment
 After the soil  the kitchen   says Mr. Clark
The first major change was that of providing wholewheat bread instead of white bread
 Adults take a long time to convince and you are thwarted if you try to push 
At first the kitchen help was tolerant  but ordered their own supply of white bread for themselves
 You can't make French toast with whole-wheat bread   was an early complaint
Mrs. Clark  as house manager  planned the menus and cared for the ordering
Then Miss Lillian Colman came from Vermont to be kitchen manager
Today whole grains are freshly ground every day and baked into bread
A mill stands in a room off the kitchen
Surrounding it are metal cans of grains ordered from organic farms in the state
Miss Colman pours measures of whole wheat  oats  and soy beans and turns on the motor
She goes on about her work and listens for the completion of the grinding
The bread baked from this mixture is light in color and fragrant in aroma
It is well liked by the children and faculty
There is one problem with the bread
They serve cracked wheat  oats or cornmeal
Occasionally  the children find steamed  whole-wheat grains for cereal which they call  buckshot 
When they leave for vacations they miss the hot cereal
The school has received letters from parents asking   What happened to Johnny  
He never used to like any hot cereal  now that's the only kind he wants
Where can we get this cereal he likes so much   
Salads are served at least once a day
Vegetables are served liberally
Most come from the root cellar or from the freezer
Home-made sauerkraut is served once a week
Sprouted grains and seeds are used in salads and dishes such as chop suey
Milk appears twice a day
The school raises enough poultry  pigs  and beef cattle for most of their needs
Lots of cheese made from June grass milk is served
Hens are kept on the range and roosters are kept with them for their fertility
Organ meats such as beef and chicken liver  tongue and heart are planned once a week
Also  salt water fish is on the table once a week
For deserts  puddings and pies are each served once a week
Most other desserts are fruit in some form  fresh fruits once daily at least  sometimes at snack time
Dried fruits are purchased from sources where they are neither sulphured nor sprayed
Apples come from a farm in Vermont where they are not sprayed
Oranges and grapefruit are shipped from Florida weekly from an organic farm
Finding sources for these high quality foods is a problem
Sometimes the solution comes in unexpected ways
Miss Colman hopes to find suitable shakers so that kelp can be available at the tables
Raw wheat-germ is available on the breakfast table for the children to help themselves
Very few fried foods are used and the use of salt and pepper is discouraged
Drinking with meals is also discouraged  
pitchers of water merely appear on the tables
Nothing is peeled
The source is known so there is no necessity to remove insecticide residues
On their frequent hikes into the nearby mountains  the children carry whole grains to munch along the trail
Maple syrup is made by the children in the woods on the school grounds
Candy is not allowed
The heavy meal comes in the middle of the day
Soup is often the important dish at supper
Homemade of meat  bones and vegetables  it is rich in dissolved minerals and vitamins
The cost to feed one person is just under one dollar a day
A vigorous program existed in skiing  skating sports and overnight hiking
Visitors to the school ask what shampoo they use on the children's hair to bring out the sheen
The ruddy complexion of the faces also brings comment
